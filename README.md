# Tv_Card_Game
### 80's tv game show card game Higher/Lower.

### Original idea
Original idea was for players to click first card and based on that randomly generated card decide
weather the next card will be higher or lower.

This is my first real attempt at a project but i've ran into some problems which have me stumped.

#### Problems seeking Solutions
First random card works ok but not after that nothing.

There has to be a better than having 52 url's 1 for each card.

Not exactly DRY code.
